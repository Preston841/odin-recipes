    <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/QdnmyjytvjqjtXxgelO31HU9DB8=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1014212-fc937371084b44e9b04f77ed8a3b2bad.jpg">
    <p>Grilled asparagus is simple to make, 
        but it lets you enjoy the natural flavor of your veggies. 
        Fresh asparagus spears are coated with a bit of 
        oil, salt, and pepper and cooked quickly 
        over high heat on the grill. That's it!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Asparagus:</strong> Start with a pound of fresh, clean, trimmed asparagus.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Olive oil keeps the asparagus from drying out and gives the seasonings something to stick to. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This grilled asparagus is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Lightly coat the asparagus spears with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Cook asparagus on the preheated grill, turning often until lightly charred and fork-tender about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
